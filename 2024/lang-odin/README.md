# Advent of Code, 2024 - Odin

To run the code you'll need [Odin](http://odin-lang.org/). Once installed you can run the desired solution with:

```
odin run dayNN -- ../inputs/dayNN.txt
```

where `NN` is the day you're working on, e.g. `day01/`, and `../inputs/day01.txt` is the input file for that day.

- [Day 1](./day01/main.odin)
- [Day 2](./day02/main.odin)
