# Advent of Code, 2024 - Wry (my own toy language)

## ⚠️ does not compile yet ⚠️

To run the code you'll need [Wry](https://github.com/wolfadex/wry-lang). Once cloned you can run the desired solution with:

```
npm run dev dayNN -- ../inputs/dayNN.txt && node runner.js
```

where `NN` is the day you're working on, e.g. `day01`, and `../inputs/day01.txt` is the input file for that day.

- [Day 1](./day01/main.wry)
