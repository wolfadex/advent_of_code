# Advent of Code, 2022 - Elm

To run the code you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once installed you can run the desired solution with:

```
npm start src/DayNN.elm input.txt
```

where `NN` is the day you're working on, e.g. `Day01.elm`, and `input.txt` is the input file for that day.

- [Day 1](./src/Day01.elm)
- [Day 2](./src/Day02.elm)
