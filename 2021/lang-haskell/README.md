# Advent of Code, 2021 - Haskell

To run the code you'll need [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). Once installed you can run the desired solution with:

```
stack run dayN input.txt
```

where `N` is the day you're wokring on, e.g. `day1`, and `input.txt` is the input file for that day.

- [Day 1](./app/Day01.hs)
- [Day 2](./app/Day02.hs)
- [Day 3](./app/Day03.hs)
