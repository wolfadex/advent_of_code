# Advent of Code, 2021 - C

To run the code you'll need [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or another C compiler. Once installed you can compile the desired solution with:

```
> clang -o dayN dayN.c runner.c
```

Where `N` is the day number, e.g. `clang -o day01 day01.c runner.c`. Then you run that day against an input with:

```
> ./dayN input.txt
```

- [Day 1](./day01.c)
