# Advent of Code, 2020 - Haskell

To run the code you'll need [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). Once installed you can run the desired solution with:

```
stack run -- ../inputs/dayNN.txt NN #
```

where `NN` is the day you're wokring on, e.g. 01, and # is the part of the day, e.g. 1 or 2.

- [Day 1](./src/Day01.hs)
- [Day 2](./src/Day02.hs)
- [Day 3](./src/Day03.hs)
- Day 4
- [Day 5](./src/Day05.hs)
- [Day 6](./src/Day06.hs)
- [Day 7](./src/Day07.hs)
